THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

    		JULES

Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

    		JULES

How you boys doin'?

No answer.

    		JULES
    (to Brett)

Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question.

    		BRETT

We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

    		JULES

Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: "No."

    		JULES

We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?

No answer.

    		JULES
    (to Brett)

Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?

    		BRETT

I'm Brett.

    		JULES

I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

    		BRETT

I remember him.

    		JULES

Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?

    		BRETT

Hamburgers.

    		JULES

Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?

    		BRETT

Cheeseburgers.

    		JULES

No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

    		BRETT

Big Kahuna Burger.

    		JULES

Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?

    		BRETT

They're good.

    		JULES

Mind if I try one of yours?

    		BRETT

No.

    		JULES

Yours is this one, right?

    		BRETT

Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

    		JULES

Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?

    		VINCENT

No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

    		JULES

You wanna bite, they're real good.

    		VINCENT

I ain't hungry.

    		JULES

Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

    		BRETT

No.

    		JULES

Tell 'em, Vincent.

    		VINCENT

Royale with Cheese.

    		JULES

Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?

    		BRETT

Because of the metric system?

    		JULES

Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast
food drink cup)
What's in this?

    		BRETT

Sprite.

    		JULES

Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?

    		BRETT

Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

    		JULES

Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

    		JULES

Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

    		MARVIN

It's under the be –

    		JULES

– I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

    		ROGER

It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
a black snap briefcase.

    		VINCENT

Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
just stares at it, transfixed.

    		JULES

We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

    		JULES

Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

    		JULES

We happy?

Closing the case.

    		VINCENT

We're happy.

    		BRETT
    (to Jules)

Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

    		JULES

My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit.

    		BRETT

I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions –

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

    		JULES
    (to Brett)

Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that. Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about "best
intentions."

Brett can't say a word.

    		JULES

Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway. Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
front of an interrogator.

    		JULES

What country you from!

    		BRETT
    (petrified)

What?

    		JULES

"What" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in "What?"

    		BRETT
    (near heart attack)

What?

    		JULES

English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

    		BRETT

Yes.

    		JULES

Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

    		BRETT

Yes.

    		JULES

Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

    		BRETT
    (out of fear)

What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
cheek.

    		JULES

Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What"
again! I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say "What" one more
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

    		JULES

Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

    		BRETT

Well he's... he's... black –

    		JULES

– go on!

    		BRETT

...and he's... he's... bald –

    		JULES

– does he look like a bitch?!

    		BRETT
    (without thinking)

What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in
the chair.

    		JULES

Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

    		BRETT
    (in agony)

No.

    		JULES

Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!

    		BRETT
    (in spasm)

I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

    		JULES

Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?

    		BRETT
    (in spasm)

Yes.

    		JULES

There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you."
